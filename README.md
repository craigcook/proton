Proton
======

Proton is a simple CSS framework for building web
page prototypes. It is explicitly intended for basic
prototyping, not for real websites.

Use this to put together a quick proof-of-concept or
rough wireframe. The results will be rudimentarily
functional but intentionally ugly.

Features
--------

* Responsive, fluid, mobile-first grid system.
* Uses plain (un-pre-processed) CSS.
* Requires loads of presentational classes.
* Encourages semantically meaningless container elements.
* Little to no backwards compatibility with older browsers.
* Zero performance optimization. Any percieved speed is accidental.
* Everything lives in an ugly gray box.

This code is unshippable.
